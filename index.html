                <h1>PROMOTING KINGDOM</h1>
                <p>Godterest is making history for being the anomaly in the online dating scene by sticking
                    to the biblical principles for dating. We are just a few disciples who started this project
                    with nothing but absolute faith in God to provide and lead the way. And in 2023,
                    Godterest became the first faith-based dating app to receive donations to carry out
                    God's mission to further His Kingdom.</p>

                <h1>DATING GOD'S WAY</h1>
                <p>At Godterest, we believe that when Christians follow biblical principles for dating, they
                    will find their God-ordained spouse and build a marriage filled with joy and faith. With the
                    alarming divorce rate at 57% for non-Christians and 33% for Christians, we are confident
                    that Godterest can significantly alter that rate in the days ahead.
                    Findings have revealed that practicing Christians have significantly happier marriages
                    than any other group studied. About 73% of practicing Christians stated they were "very
                    satisfied" with their marriage compared to 59% of U.S. adults and 54% of non-practicing
                    Christians and non-Christians alike.
                    While most dating apps facilitate casual dates and hookups, Godterest not only gets you
                    out on a great date, but sets you and your date on the track for a successful marriage</p>

                </h1>
                <p>We have been long mislead on what it means to be in a relationship, why we
                    should seek relationships, and how we should live them out. For too long, our
                    team has pondered on the possibility of a guide book telling Christians how to build and maintain a healthy and meaningful relationship, and we're excited to
                    let you know there is: The bible is that guide book!
